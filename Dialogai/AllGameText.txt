So this child lays in the bed and reads of an army of brainless mice, called gendarmes, that burn any book they find. They know that books are a source of magic. It is the only power strong enough to defeat them and their master. And so they seek to destroy it entirely. In these dire times, a group of heroes is formed. These brave creatures carry the books to all over the land, so that the others can learn magic, and it can't ever be destroyed. They bring magic and hope, wherever thy go and thus, people started calling them bringers of books. One of those heroes is fighting right now."],
[1,"A child wakes up, surrounded by fire. There is smoke around a house. The door can't be open, so the child climbs out of the window and falls to the ground. The house is in flames. Little mouse tries to use magic like all those heroes in the books, but nothing happens. {insertname} starts to cry but stops when a laughter is heard. Looking around the corner, the child sees gendarmes happily laughing at the burning house. {insertname} knows, that gendarmes are stupid and won't look over their heads, so little child sneaks out, by jumping from one tree to the other. Unfortunately {insertname} doesn't get far away, before one of them notices a little child running."],
[2,"Instead of a few evil, brainless mice, this time the field is full of gendarmes. And yet, the bringer of books fights bravely, taking hit after hit. And just as the child is hopeful that the battle is won and the enemy is retreating a path of fire appears around the hero. Far, far in the distance the little mouse sees a different looking gendarme appearing. And in its paw a glowing torch. 'General!' Shouts evil solders. The general lifts flaming torch in the air and the magical book the hero is holding is burned to ashes. The brave mouse falls to the ground. 'Get the chains!' Orders general. 'This prisoner won't escape this time'. 'I will save you' quietly promises {insertname}"],
[3,"Just as {insertname} about to attack, with full ferocity of a child, the general drops the magical weapon and starts to beg for mercy. While the child ponders what to do, the writers release chained hero and a quick spell later, the general no longer exists. Having won a difficult battle everyone starts to celebrate. {insertname} quickly gets bored of adults drinking smelly beverages and decides to go and read another book."],
